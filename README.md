# Soldier Defense

Lead your soldiers to victory in this strategic and fast-paced game.
Green balls are your soldiers, red balls are enemies.

Every enemy you defeat gives you gold. Use it wisely to recruit more soldiers by tapping the plus button.
But be careful: too many soldiers can lose morale and stop following your orders.

Each round brings more enemies, and if their numbers surpass yours by five, they will unite and attack directly.
Balance your army, plan your strategy, and make every decision count.
